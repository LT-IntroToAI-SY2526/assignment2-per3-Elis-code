This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.

2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
I when iterating thought the pattern and source if a % occoured not at the end of source it was hard to code.


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
